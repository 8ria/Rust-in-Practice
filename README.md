# 🦀 Rust-in-Practice

**A practical Rust learning journey — from beginner to pro, one project at a time.**

This repository is a hands-on guide to learning Rust by **building real, working mini-projects**. Each project is implemented in three progressively more advanced styles:

* **Beginner** – Simple, readable, and ideal for newcomers.
* **Intermediate** – Idiomatic Rust with improved structure and some abstraction.
* **Pro** – Optimized, expressive, and built with deeper knowledge of Rust’s capabilities.

Whether you're just starting out or brushing up on advanced concepts, this repo is your practical Rust companion.

## 📁 Repository Structure

```
Rust-in-Practice/
├── Beginner/       # Beginner-level Rust implementations
├── Intermediate/   # Intermediate-level improvements and idiomatic patterns
└── Pro/            # Advanced, performant, and elegant Rust code
```

Each folder contains the same set of projects written in different Rust levels for learning comparison.

## 🚀 How to Run

Make sure you have Rust installed. You can get it via [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs).

```bash
# Example: Run beginner version of Hangman
cd Beginner
rustc Hangman.rs
./Hangman
```

You can do the same in `Intermediate/` or `Pro/` to compare implementations.
